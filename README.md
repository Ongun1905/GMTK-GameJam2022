### Description

This is a submission to the GMTK Game Jam 2022 by a group of TU/e Game Dev members -- The Unfair Game.

The Unfair Game is a digital board game with DND-inspired combat elements.

To play, click the dice on the right-hand side of your screen. Just like a normal board game, this allows you to move across the playing field. But watch out! Danger might be lurking beneath the X-squares...

When in doubt or stuck, click the dice. It may help more than you'd expect...

Try to get the highest score you can! Points are earned by completing game loops and defeating any danger on your journey.
